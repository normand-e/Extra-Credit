            <p>The first case of neural networks was in 1943, when neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician
                Walter Pitts wrote a paper about neurons, and how they work. They decided to create a model of this
                using an electrical circuit, and therefore the neural network was born. Another extremely early instance
                of a neural network came in 1959, when Bernard Widrow and Marcian Hoff created two models of them at
                Stanford University. The first was called ADELINE, and it could detect binary patterns. For example, in
                a stream of bits, it could predict what the next one would be. The next generation was called MADELINE,
                and it could eliminate echo on phone lines, so had a useful real world application. It is still in use
                today.</p>

                1982 was the year in which interest in neural networks started to pick up again, when John Hopfield
                suggested creating a network which had bidirectional lines, similar to how neurons actually work.
                Furthermore, in 1982, Japan announced it was focusing on more advanced neural networks, which
                incentivised American funding into the area, and thus created more research in the area.</p>
